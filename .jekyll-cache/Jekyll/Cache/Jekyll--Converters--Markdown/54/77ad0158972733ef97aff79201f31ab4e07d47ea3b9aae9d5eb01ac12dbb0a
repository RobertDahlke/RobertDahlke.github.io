  <li>Altered Traits gives a history of scientific research about meditation.</li>
  <li>It methodically lists the possible and the proven effects of meditation and acknowledges the shortcomings of research especially in regards to meditation technique and experiment design.</li>
  <li>Meditation can have a lot of positive health effects, especially if it is practiced regularly, over a long time with occasional meditation retreats.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="impressions">Impressions</h1>

<p>The studies of meditation are young and there is still a lot unknown. The things that are known are positive, but get exaggerated by a lot of people. Meditation has a lot of health and personality benefits but is also quite a time investment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I will take up longer daily meditations</li>
  <li>I am thinking about incorporating retreats since they have been shown to alter traits more than regular practice.</li>
  <li>I will explore different practices since there seems to be variance between the effects of practices.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="-summary">üìí Summary</h1>

<p>The first few chapters of the book describe how Daniel Goleman and Richard Ja Davidson come to study meditation, and how their studies are first received with skepticism during the time of the paradigm of behavioral psychology. The book is filled with stories of how the Authors came to study the effects they studied, then proceeds with the experiment, and then with the outcome.</p>

<p>The second half of Altered Traits is focused on the scientific findings and on busting myths that are not supported by science.</p>

<p>Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an eight-week evidence-based program that offers secular, intensive mindfulness training to assist people with stress, anxiety, depression and pain. Developed at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in the 1970s by Professor Jon Kabat-Zinn, MBSR uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, yoga and exploration of patterns of behaviour, thinking, feeling and action.</p>
