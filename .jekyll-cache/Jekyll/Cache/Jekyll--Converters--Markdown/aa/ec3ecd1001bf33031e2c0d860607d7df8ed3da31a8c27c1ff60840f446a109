<ol>
  <li>Altered Traits gives a history of scientific research about meditation.</li>
  <li>It methodically lists the possible and the proven effects of meditation and acknowledges the shortcomings of research especially in regards to meditation technique and experiment design.</li>
  <li>Meditation can have a lot of positive health effects, especially if it is practiced regularly, over a long time with occasional meditation retreats.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="-impressions">🎨 Impressions</h1>

<p>The studies of meditation are young and there is still a lot unknown. The things that are known are positive, but get exaggerated by a lot of people. Meditation has a lot of health and personality benefits but is also quite a time investment.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-discovered-it">How I Discovered It</h2>

<p>I heard Andrew Huberman talk about it on his Podcast.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-read-it">Who Should Read It?</h2>

<p>Anyone interested in the scientific research into meditation and in the effects of meditation.</p>

<h1 id="️-how-the-book-changed-me">☘️ How the Book Changed Me</h1>

<ul>
  <li>I will take up longer daily meditations</li>
  <li>I am thinking about incorporating retreats since they have been shown to alter traits more than regular practice.</li>
  <li>I will explore different practices since there seems to be variance between the effects of practices.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="-summary">📒 Summary</h1>

<p>The first few chapters of the book describe how Daniel Goleman and Richard Ja Davidson come to study meditation, and how their studies are first received with skepticism during the time of the paradigm of behavioral psychology. The book is filled with stories of how the Authors came to study the effects they studied, then proceeds with the experiment, and then with the outcome.</p>

<p>The second half of Altered Traits is focused on the scientific findings and on busting myths that are not supported by science.</p>

<h3 id="mindfulness-based-stress-reduction">Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</h3>

<p>Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an eight-week evidence-based program that offers secular, intensive mindfulness training to assist people with stress, anxiety, depression and pain. Developed at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in the 1970s by Professor Jon Kabat-Zinn, MBSR uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, yoga and exploration of patterns of behaviour, thinking, feeling and action.</p>

<h3 id="vipassana-meditation">Vipassana Meditation</h3>

<p>Vipassana is a Buddhist term that is often translated as “insight”.  It is often defined as a practice that seeks “insight into the true nature of reality”, defined as anicca “impermanence”, dukkha “suffering, unsatisfactoriness”, anattā “non-self”, the three marks of existence in the Theravada tradition, and as śūnyatā “emptiness” and Buddha-nature in the Mahayana traditions.</p>

<p>The amygdala shows dampened activity from thirty hours of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction training.</p>

<p>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction strengthens selective attention while Vipassana Meditation enhances it more. Three months after a Vipassana retreat, there is still an increase in vigilance.</p>

<p>About ten hours of mindfulness over a two-week period strengthened attention and working memory.</p>

<p>Mindfulness reduces inflammation and experienced practitioners have downregulated gene expression of inflammation genes.</p>

<p>Loving-kindness meditation increases amygdala activation when watching people suffer, which is indicative of higher compassion.</p>
